# Advent of Code 2016

> [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme. 

This is the repo where I'll post my solutions for the AoC 2016. 

I decided to participate to the Advent of Code initiative in a non-competitive way, mostly because I don't know if I'll have the time to partecipate on a regular daily basis, but I still think it is a good problem-solving exercise. Also, I hope to [learn something new](what-i-learned.md) out of this!

My weapon of choice is Javascript (ES6), but I may use other languages during the journey.

To execute the scripts, you can run them from the command line: 

`babel day1.js --presets es2015 | node`
